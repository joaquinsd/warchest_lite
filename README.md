# WarchestLite

This project is a console version of board game Warchest built on Ruby,
this is part of my Eventbrite Software Development application
### Why Ruby?
I chose to write the game implementation in ruby since it's the first programming language I learnt
## Running the Game

In a console that can run ruby ðŸ¤“ðŸ’Ž access to the folder ``lib`` inside the repo and run:

```shell
ruby warchest.rb
```
## License

The gem is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## Code of Conduct

Everyone interacting in the WarchestLite projectâ€™s codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms and mailing lists is expected to follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/[USERNAME]/warchest_lite/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Keep in mind
I'm not very used to write gems, hence the lack of coherence in this one. 

Also because of time constraints, I was not able to write relevant tests; hopefully I will before
sending it to review

I tried my best to cover all border cases, though the lack of adequate tests could make this **bold** statement completely invalid.
